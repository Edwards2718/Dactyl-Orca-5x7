This keypad is based on the Dactyl Manuform and is inspired by the Razer Orbweaver and the Kensington Expert Mouse. The differences between it and the Manuform are:

- The thumb module is a levered (fin) button that uses a standard mouse microswitch.

- The 'R' key has been recessed to align with the 'E' key. On the Orca WASD movement is now ESDF, and it is now easier to simultaneously press the 'E' & 'R' keys using my middle finger (this is useful in FPS games that have Sprint keys). I could even revert the 'R' key to its original Manuform height using an MX keycap stem extender.

This repo contains the ZMK firmware, CAD models, and design document for the Dactyl Orca. **Note**: View the design document PDF in negative color mode.
